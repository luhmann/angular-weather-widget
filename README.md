# Angular Weather Widget

This is an implementation of a very simple Angular component that displays the current temperature
in a city that is passed into a directive. It uses webpack and the local styles approach of the module-syntax
within the css-loader.

### Installation

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
